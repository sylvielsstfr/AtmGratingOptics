Calculation of optical beam configuration at auxiliary telescope, when a Ronchi Grating is used to
measure star spectra for evaluating atmosphere transparency.

Simple Optical 2D geometry is used. No detailed ray tracing is done.

Few notebooks are available:
- notebook with Sagemath installed
- notebook with python 2.7

##  notebook with python 2.7

- AuxTelOptGeom_CTIO.ipynb

This one must be used.

## notebook with Sagemath

- AuxTelOptGeom_CTIO_sagenb.ipynb	
- SimpleCalculationOptics.ipynb

Above notebooks are just for Sagemath capabilities evaluation.
